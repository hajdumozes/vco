Quite an unfortunate series of events, for which the Craventail surely played no part!\\n\\nThe wily Chieftain watched the battle play out, concealed within a cluster of stalactites on the underway's ceiling.

Both warriors knew that the battle was over.\\n\\nThorgrim gave one last, anaemic swing, and Vlad effortlessly checked the blow, seizing him by the wrist. Balefire flashed, and Thorgrim staggered back. His flesh grew sallow and withered, his beard fell out in great clumps, and then he collapsed into dust.\\n\\nNone now stand to oppose Vlad's conquest of the Everpeak. The vast network of tunnels will take many years to fully plunder, and so a decision must be made.

They all knew what fate awaited those who displeased the Witch King.\\n\\nMalus made the long climb back to his personal chambers, situated at the highest steeple of the ship. There a mirror stood, but the reflection within made no attempt to mirror his own movements.\\n\\n[[i]]Mighty Darkblade, the errand boy![[/i]] Tz'arkan's voice echoed through his mind as his twisted reflection mouthed the daemon's words. [[i]]Is that our fate, to bow and scrape to his every whim?[[/i]]\\n\\n“Shut [[i]]up[[/i]], daemon,” Malus growled under his breath, gritting his teeth.\\n\\n[[i]]You could be more, Malus. So much more. With hate, all things are possible...[[/i]]	false
