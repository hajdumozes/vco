missions_localised_title_vco_custom_quest_tretch	Moonfall	false
missions_localised_description_vco_custom_quest_tretch	A large pillar of dark-green light pulses forth from the Tower of Gorgoth and smashes into the Chaos Moon. Tidal waves of entropic energy pulse through the atmosphere, and Morskrit disgorges its precious gifts. Tretch groans with frustration as the shower of meteors crashes somewhere far to the north, well away from the slopes of Crookback Mountain, as promised. Cursing the Grey Seers for their incompetence, Tretch gathers his raiders and sets out to claim the precious warpstone before someone else gets to it first.	false

battle_set_pieces_localised_description_vco_tretch_battle_warpstone_meteor	Curses! Vampires from the Silver Pinnacle have reached the impact crater of what has to be one of the largest warpstone meteors Tretch has ever seen. No doubt they seek to harvest the precious substance for some unholy spell. Unacceptable! With a slash of his tail, Tretch orders his Stormvermin forward. The dead will know to fear Clan Rictus, yes-yes!	false

scripted_objectives_localised_text_vco_tretch_custom_quest_message_chaos_dwarf_reinforcements	Greedy beard-things come for what's mine-mine! Must kill-eat them all!	false
missions_localised_title_vco_wh2_dlc14_qb_skv_final_battle_snikch	Shadow Meets Blade	false
missions_localised_description_vco_wh2_dlc14_qb_skv_final_battle_snikch	The location of the great power was finally revealed to Snikch through the words of a captured Vampire Admiral, whose ship had floundered on Cathay's treacherous coast.\\n\\n“You are a fool, ratling peon,” the Vampire spat, “for the power you seek is a Daemon of Slaanesh, and no minor Daemon at that! Tz’arkan, the Drinker of Worlds, is a ravenous monster inextricably bound to the soul of a living entity. The only chance of severing the Chaos-imbued bond is to destroy the vessel in which the Daemon is trapped. That vessel is none other than the Druchii known as Malus Darkblade.”\\n\\nThe prospect of wielding the power of a Daemon suddenly sounded very good to the Deathmaster. Almost as soon as he’d ordered his spies to find Darkblade’s location, word returned that the Druchii tyrant was in the area, but about to board his Black Ark back to Naggaroth. He cannot be allowed to escape!	false
missions_localised_title_vco_wh2_dlc09_qb_tmb_final_battle_arkhan	Battle of the Black Pyramid	false
missions_localised_description_vco_wh2_dlc09_qb_tmb_final_battle_arkhan	The books, along with the Necromancer’s staff, have awoken the Black Pyramid. And so the carrion circle. The Tomb Kings have always lusted for power in life and especially in death. Settra comes, leading an undying alliance to wrest the pyramid from its creator’s most loyal servant. The Followers of Nagash raise their warriors even as the Black Pyramid climbs into the sky. The battle for its control is about to begin.	false
missions_localised_title_vco_wh2_dlc13_qb_emp_final_battle_wulfhart	Battle for Itza	false
missions_localised_description_vco_wh2_dlc13_qb_emp_final_battle_wulfhart	Lustria’s jungles burn. Its temple-cities crumble. Under Markus Wulfhart’s command, the Emperor’s forces have wreaked havoc in the New World, wantonly plundering the lucrative holdings of the lizard-beasts while sweeping aside all foes sent against them. But now, the most monstrous of them of all has been roused.\\n\\nWulfhart's scouts have informed him that the creature known as the Spirit of the Jungle has been sighted somewhere in the vicinity of Itza. The Huntsmarshal has caught the scent; this will be his toughest hunt yet.	false
missions_localised_title_vco_wh2_dlc13_qb_lzd_final_battle_nakai	Battle for Itza	false
missions_localised_description_vco_wh2_dlc13_qb_lzd_final_battle_nakai	One by one, Nakai fought off the so-called great hunters in cahoots with the Huntsmarshal. And one by one, they fled into the jungle like the warm-blooded cowards they are. Nakai correctly sensed they would be back for more, and now the chief warmblood himself, Markus Wulfhart, takes to the field with them. Lustria’s future hangs in the balance, for why else would Nakai be so compelled to act? This conflict ends now!	false
missions_localised_title_vco_wh2_dlc16_qb_wef_final_battle_sisters	The Root of Chaos	false
missions_localised_description_vco_wh2_dlc16_qb_wef_final_battle_sisters	Though the Great Vortex stifles Daemonkind, a rift in the Witchwood provides Chaos with another passageway into the world. Ariel, demigoddess of the Asrai and avatar of Isha, channels all her power to seal the portal, hoping to prevent the Daemons of the Dreaming Wood from entering the mortal plane. Somehow, scheming Skaven know the Mage Queen is vulnerable, and are preparing to attack. The Sisters of Twilight must dispatch them before they can disrupt Ariel’s efforts and bring cataclysm to the world.	false
missions_localised_title_vco_wh2_dlc16_qb_skv_final_battle_throt	The Ultimate Harvest	false
missions_localised_description_vco_wh2_dlc16_qb_skv_final_battle_throt	Following Throt’s repeated attacks upon the Waystone sites in Naggaroth, Ariel has begun her ritual in the Witchwood! From the moment Clan Moulder had learned about the Mage Queen’s plans, Throt wondered how such a juicy tip-off could so conveniently land on his lap, but assumed it had something to do with the forest-things’ squabbles amongst themselves. It matters little to him now – with Ariel’s powers focused on her ritual, she is exposed, giving Throt the chance to finally obtain the greatest specimen he will likely ever get his foul claws on. By his haphazard calculations, consuming the demigoddess’ life essence will not only cure his extreme case of the Black Hunger, but could also make him more powerful than he could ever imagine. Moreover, after having his fill who knows what delightfully horrible things he can create in his laboratory using the leftover Queen-pulp? The possibilities are endless!\\n\\nAs purported by the tree-thing informant, Ariel should be vulnerable while she performs her ritual, but will not be unprotected. She will undoubtedly have her strongest lieutenants defending her, so Throt must fill his ranks with Moulder’s most dangerous monsters to ensure nothing can stop him from claiming Ariel as his prize.	false
missions_localised_title_vco_custom_quest_alarielle_hellebron	The Blood Queen Strikes	false
missions_localised_description_vco_custom_quest_alarielle_hellebron	Disaster! A great Druchii fleet has laid siege to the Straits of Lothern, led by the infamous Lokhir Fellheart. While Sea Lord Aislinn and Prince Tyrion saw to the harbour's defence, a smaller contingent made their way into the Inner Sea, masquerading as civilian ships fleeing the conflict. They are led by the Blood Queen of Har Ganeth, Crone Hellebron, and are sailing with all speed for the Isle of the Dead. Whatever her designs for the Great Vortex, they cannot come to pass!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_name_vco_alarielle_battle_crones_folly	The Crone's Folly	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_vco_alarielle_battle_crones_folly	Hellebron's forces have made landfall on the Isle of the Dead, arriving moments before your own troops. The bloodthirsty Crone seeks to offer up Caledor Dragontamer and his archmages in a grand sacrificial ritual to Khaine. Such folly would spell doom not only for Ulthuan, but the whole world. She must be stopped!	false
battle_set_piece_armies_army_onscreen_name_vco_custom_quest_alarielle_hellebron_enemy_army_def_crones	Hellebron's Blood Voyage	false
scripted_objectives_localised_text_vco_alarielle_custom_quest_hellebron_message_valkia_descends	It seems the Gorequeen and Blood Queen have found common cause. Stand firm, Asur! Protect the Vortex!	false
missions_localised_title_vco_wh3_main_ie_qb_bst_final_battle_taurox	The Heart of the Dark	false
missions_localised_description_vco_wh3_main_ie_qb_bst_final_battle_taurox	Finally, the beast-paths to the Heart of the Dark are revealed! Taurox had marauded mercilessly through the world, the promise of further gifts of Chaos fuelling his never-ending stampede. His Masters’ true goal, however, had always been to usher the Daemons of Chaos into the world, and only a pilgrimage of sacrifice and Ruin, ending at the Heart of the Dark, would make it so.\\n\\nIt appears others have made the journey also – some with different intentions – but with the final rite within his grasp the Brass Bull will not be denied the Gods’ favour!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_name_vco_wh2_dlc17_qb_bst_final_battle_taurox	The Heart of the Dark	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_vco_wh2_dlc17_qb_bst_final_battle_taurox	The place known as the Heart of the Dark is a destination never spoken of, but the way to the malignant monolith at its centre is always revealed to those who have the Dark Gods’ favour. Even their Ruinous plan to bring about another Coming of Chaos through the power of the mighty Herdstone matters little to the Brass Bull, for he wishes only to be given the power to rampage eternally and feed his perpetual Bloodgreed. Enemies abound as rivals also seek such power, while ancient foes stalk in the shadows.	false
