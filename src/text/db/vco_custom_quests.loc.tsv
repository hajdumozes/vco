missions_localised_title_vco_custom_quest_tretch	Moonfall	false
missions_localised_description_vco_custom_quest_tretch	A large pillar of dark-green light pulses forth from the Tower of Gorgoth and smashes into the Chaos Moon. Tidal waves of entropic energy pulse through the atmosphere, and Morskrit disgorges its precious gifts. Tretch groans with frustration as the shower of meteors crashes somewhere far to the north, well away from the slopes of Crookback Mountain, as promised. Cursing the Grey Seers for their incompetence, Tretch gathers his raiders and sets out to claim the precious warpstone before someone else gets to it first.	false

battle_set_pieces_localised_description_vco_tretch_battle_warpstone_meteor	Curses! Vampires from the Silver Pinnacle have reached the impact crater of what has to be one of the largest warpstone meteors Tretch has ever seen. No doubt they seek to harvest the precious substance for some unholy spell. Unacceptable! With a slash of his tail, Tretch orders his Stormvermin forward. The dead will know to fear Clan Rictus, yes-yes!	false

missions_localised_title_vco_wh2_dlc14_qb_skv_final_battle_snikch	Shadow Meets Blade	false
missions_localised_description_vco_wh2_dlc14_qb_skv_final_battle_snikch	The location of the great power was finally revealed to Snikch through the words of a captured Vampire Admiral, whose ship had floundered on Cathay's treacherous coast.\\n\\n“You are a fool, ratling peon,” the Vampire spat, “for the power you seek is a Daemon of Slaanesh, and no minor Daemon at that! Tz’arkan, the Drinker of Worlds, is a ravenous monster inextricably bound to the soul of a living entity. The only chance of severing the Chaos-imbued bond is to destroy the vessel in which the Daemon is trapped. That vessel is none other than the Druchii known as Malus Darkblade.”\\n\\nThe prospect of wielding the power of a Daemon suddenly sounded very good to the Deathmaster. Almost as soon as he’d ordered his spies to find Darkblade’s location, word returned that the Druchii tyrant was in the area, but about to board his Black Ark back to Naggaroth. He cannot be allowed to escape!	false
missions_localised_title_vco_wh2_dlc09_qb_tmb_final_battle_arkhan	Battle of the Black Pyramid	false
missions_localised_description_vco_wh2_dlc09_qb_tmb_final_battle_arkhan	The books, along with the Necromancer’s staff, have awoken the Black Pyramid. And so the carrion circle. The Tomb Kings have always lusted for power in life and especially in death. Settra comes, leading an undying alliance to wrest the pyramid from its creator’s most loyal servant. The Followers of Nagash raise their warriors even as the Black Pyramid climbs into the sky. The battle for its control is about to begin.	false
missions_localised_title_vco_wh2_dlc13_qb_emp_final_battle_wulfhart	Battle for Itza	false
missions_localised_description_vco_wh2_dlc13_qb_emp_final_battle_wulfhart	Lustria’s jungles burn. Its temple-cities crumble. Under Markus Wulfhart’s command, the Emperor’s forces have wreaked havoc in the New World, wantonly plundering the lucrative holdings of the lizard-beasts while sweeping aside all foes sent against them. But now, the most monstrous of them of all has been roused.\\n\\nWulfhart's scouts have informed him that the creature known as the Spirit of the Jungle has been sighted somewhere in the vicinity of Itza. The Huntsmarshal has caught the scent; this will be his toughest hunt yet.	false
missions_localised_title_vco_wh2_dlc13_qb_lzd_final_battle_nakai	Battle for Itza	false
missions_localised_description_vco_wh2_dlc13_qb_lzd_final_battle_nakai	One by one, Nakai fought off the so-called great hunters in cahoots with the Huntsmarshal. And one by one, they fled into the jungle like the warm-blooded cowards they are. Nakai correctly sensed they would be back for more, and now the chief warmblood himself, Markus Wulfhart, takes to the field with them. Lustria’s future hangs in the balance, for why else would Nakai be so compelled to act? This conflict ends now!	false
missions_localised_title_vco_wh2_dlc16_qb_wef_final_battle_sisters	The Root of Chaos	false
missions_localised_description_vco_wh2_dlc16_qb_wef_final_battle_sisters	Though the Great Vortex stifles Daemonkind, a rift in the Witchwood provides Chaos with another passageway into the world. Ariel, demigoddess of the Asrai and avatar of Isha, channels all her power to seal the portal, hoping to prevent the Daemons of the Dreaming Wood from entering the mortal plane. Somehow, scheming Skaven know the Mage Queen is vulnerable, and are preparing to attack. The Sisters of Twilight must dispatch them before they can disrupt Ariel’s efforts and bring cataclysm to the world.	false
missions_localised_title_vco_wh2_dlc16_qb_skv_final_battle_throt	The Ultimate Harvest	false
missions_localised_description_vco_wh2_dlc16_qb_skv_final_battle_throt	Following Throt’s repeated attacks upon the Waystone sites in the Old World, Ariel has begun her ritual in the Witchwood! From the moment Clan Moulder had learned about the Mage Queen’s plans, Throt wondered how such a juicy tip-off could so conveniently land on his lap, but assumed it had something to do with the forest-things’ squabbles amongst themselves. It matters little to him now – with Ariel’s powers focused on her ritual, she is exposed, giving Throt the chance to finally obtain the greatest specimen he will likely ever get his foul claws on. By his haphazard calculations, consuming the demigoddess’ life essence will not only cure his extreme case of the Black Hunger, but could also make him more powerful than he could ever imagine. Moreover, after having his fill, who knows what delightfully horrible things he can create in his laboratory using the leftover Queen-pulp? The possibilities are endless!\\n\\nAs purported by the tree-thing informant, Ariel should be vulnerable while she performs her ritual, but will not be unprotected. She will undoubtedly have her strongest lieutenants defending her, so Throt must fill his ranks with Moulder’s most dangerous monsters to ensure nothing can stop him from claiming Ariel as his prize.	false
missions_localised_title_vco_custom_quest_alarielle_hellebron	The Blood Queen Strikes	false
missions_localised_description_vco_custom_quest_alarielle_hellebron	Disaster! A great Druchii fleet has laid siege to the Straits of Lothern, led by the infamous Lokhir Fellheart. While Sea Lord Aislinn and Prince Tyrion saw to the harbour's defence, a smaller contingent made their way into the Inner Sea, masquerading as civilian ships fleeing the conflict. They are led by the Blood Queen of Har Ganeth, Crone Hellebron, and are sailing with all speed for the Isle of the Dead. Whatever her designs for the Great Vortex, they cannot come to pass!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_name_vco_alarielle_battle_crones_folly	The Crone's Folly	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_vco_alarielle_battle_crones_folly	Hellebron's forces have made landfall on the Isle of the Dead, arriving moments before your own troops. The bloodthirsty Crone seeks to offer up Caledor Dragontamer and his archmages in a grand sacrificial ritual to Khaine. Such folly would spell doom not only for Ulthuan, but the whole world. She must be stopped!	false

missions_localised_title_vco_wh3_main_ie_qb_bst_final_battle_taurox	The Heart of the Dark	false
missions_localised_description_vco_wh3_main_ie_qb_bst_final_battle_taurox	Finally, the beast-paths to the Heart of the Dark are revealed! Taurox had marauded mercilessly through the world, the promise of further gifts of Chaos fuelling his never-ending stampede. His Masters’ true goal, however, had always been to usher the Daemons of Chaos into the world, and only a pilgrimage of sacrifice and Ruin, ending at the Heart of the Dark, would make it so.\\n\\nIt appears others have made the journey also – some with different intentions – but with the final rite within his grasp the Brass Bull will not be denied the Gods’ favour!	false
missions_localised_title_vco_custom_quest_alarielle_ariel	The Tears of Isha	false
missions_localised_description_vco_custom_quest_alarielle_ariel	The Wood Elves are dwindling. Some perished whilst warring in other lands, fighting for King Orion’s increasingly bloodthirsty Wild Hunts, but most sickened and died as Ariel’s corruption spread through the forests. The Everqueen has gathered many Asrai and Tree Spirits from forest enclaves across the world, and now, with the Treeman Oakheart’s support, she stands ready to confront Ariel directly.	false

battle_set_pieces_localised_description_vco_custom_quest_alarielle_ariel	At the heart of Athel Loren, Isha’s chosen and Isha’s avatar stand opposed. Ariel’s tainted soul has drawn fell spirits to her cause, though the Treeman Oakheart and his Asrai allies stand against her. Alarielle must cleanse the corruption that festers within the Queen of the Woods, or all of Athel Loren will surely wither and perish!	false
scripted_subtitles_localised_text_vco_alarielle_ariel_durthus_speech_01	A shadow spreads from Ariel's tainted heart, plunging all of Athel Loren into darkness.	false

missions_localised_description_vco_custom_quest_hellebron_alarielle	After making landfall on the shores of Ulthuan, Hellebron wasted no time slaughtering the Elves of Nagarythe and offering their hearts up to her murderous patron's shrine. With the Sword of Khaine now in hand, she leads her Blood Voyage into the verdant forests of Avelorn, leaving a trail of ash and blood in her wake. Such acts of desecration will surely draw the ire of the Everqueen, but Hellebron is unconcerned. Let her come. Her royal blood will make a fine offering to Khaine!	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_name_vco_custom_quest_hellebron_alarielle	The Desecration of Avelorn	false
battle_set_pieces_localised_description_vco_custom_quest_hellebron_alarielle	It seems that the preening Everqueen has deigned to forsake the comforts of her pavilion and confront Hellebron's invasion force at the Steps of Isha. Such folly! Have her soft hands ever even held a blade? Garlands and silks have no place on the field of battle, as she will soon discover...	false

missions_localised_description_vco_custom_quest_throt_ghoritch	Throt's ambitions in Norsca have drawn the attention of the Everchosen himself. He has gathered a great host of men and daemons to his banner and now marches on Hell Pit, intent on purging the vermin infestation at its source before it threatens to spread beyond even his control. Furious at the no-fur's impudence, Throt summons his most vicious creations and hurries to reinforce the garrison before battle is joined.	false

battle_set_pieces_localised_description_vco_custom_quest_throt_ghoritch	After days of subterranean travel, Throt arrives to Hell Pit only to discover the battle has already begun.

missions_localised_description_vco_custom_quest_belegar_skavenblight	Beneath the Blighted Marshes, the source of the Skaven infestation was discovered: a massive labyrinthine undercity; the largest ever seen by any Dwarf in living memory. Could this be the fabled heart of the Skaven empire? Belegar sends word to the High King, who calls for all able-bodied dawi to march on the city. Many grudges will be avenged this day!	false

battle_set_pieces_localised_description_vco_custom_quest_belegar_skavenblight	Skavenblight, heart of the wretched Skaven empire, lies exposed for the first time.

missions_localised_description_vco_custom_quest_belegar_eight_peaks	Since recapturing the hold, Belegar and his kinsmen have withstood plots, alliances, ambushes, super-weapons, and untold deathtraps. Three times they have been rescued by relief forces that broke through the cordon of foes to bring much-needed reinforcements, the last army led by Thorgrim himself. Belegar has sworn a mighty oath to retake Karak Eight Peaks and, inch by bloody inch, Clan Angrund has expanded its foothold.

Having already repelled multiple assaults from the ratmen that infest these jungles, he is hardly surprised when yet another horde approaches. It is the Daemon they want, but they must know as well as Malus does that they are going to have to kill him to get it. Malus had heard of the ratman assassin Deathmaster Snikch, but now has the feeling that he may be about to get much more closely acquainted with him...	false
