vco_custom_quest_alarielle_hellebron	FIGHT_SET_PIECE_BATTLE	The Blood Queen Strikes	Disaster! A great Druchii fleet has laid siege to the Straits of Lothern, led by the infamous Lokhir Fellheart. While Sea Lord Aislinn and Prince Tyrion saw to the harbour's defence, a smaller contingent made their way into the Inner Sea, masquerading as civilian ships fleeing the conflict. They are led by the Blood Queen of Har Ganeth, Crone Hellebron, and are sailing with all speed for the Isle of the Dead. Whatever her designs for the Great Vortex, they cannot come to pass!	emp/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Quest	vco_alarielle_battle_crones_folly	172	431	true	true	10.0000	1432265518	true		false
vco_custom_quest_tretch	FIGHT_SET_PIECE_BATTLE	Moonfall	Though the bulk of the Warpstone Meteors now crash at the foot of Crookback Mountain, the Grey Seers lost control of an exceptionally large Meteor that has fallen near the Silver Pinnacle. The Lahmians have sent their deathless thralls to secure the precious substance for their own dark designs. Cursing the Grey Seers for their incompetence, Tretch gathers his finest Stormvermin and sets out to intercept the Lahmians at once.\\n	bst/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Quest	vco_tretch_battle_warpstone_meteor	563	504	true	true	10.0000	1704409635	true		false
vco_wh2_dlc09_qb_tmb_final_battle_arkhan	FIGHT_SET_PIECE_BATTLE	Battle of the Black Pyramid	The books, along with the Necromancer’s staff, have awoken the Black Pyramid. And so the carrion circle. The Tomb Kings have always lusted for power in life and especially in death. Settra comes, leading an undying alliance to wrest the pyramid from its creator’s most loyal servant. The Followers of Nagash raise their warriors even as the Black Pyramid climbs into the sky. The battle for its control is about to begin.	tmb/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Quest	wh2_dlc09_qb_tmb_final_battle_arkhan	384	213	true	true	10.0000	1391587289	true		false
vco_wh2_dlc13_qb_emp_final_battle_wulfhart	FIGHT_SET_PIECE_BATTLE	Battle for Itza	Lustria’s jungles burn. Its temple-cities crumble. Under Markus Wulfhart’s command, the Emperor’s forces have wreaked havoc in the New World, wantonly plundering the lucrative holdings of the lizard-beasts while sweeping aside all foes sent against them. But now, the most monstrous of them of all has been roused.\n\nWulfhart's scouts have informed him that the creature known as the Spirit of the Jungle has been sighted somewhere in the vicinity of Itza. The Huntsmarshal has caught the scent; this will be his toughest hunt yet.	emp/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Quest	wh2_dlc13_qb_emp_final_battle_wulfhart	116	185	true	true	10.0000	1567246912	true		false
vco_wh2_dlc13_qb_lzd_final_battle_nakai	FIGHT_SET_PIECE_BATTLE	Battle for Itza	One by one, Nakai fought off the so-called great hunters in cahoots with the Huntsmarshal. And one by one, they fled into the jungle like the warm-blooded cowards they are. Nakai correctly sensed they would be back for more, and now the chief warmblood himself, Markus Wulfhart, takes to the field with them. Lustria’s future hangs in the balance, for why else would Nakai be so compelled to act? This conflict ends now!	lzd/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Quest	wh2_dlc13_qb_lzd_final_battle_nakai	116	185	true	true	10.0000	530282727	true		false
vco_wh2_dlc14_qb_skv_final_battle_snikch	FIGHT_SET_PIECE_BATTLE	Shadow Meets Blade	The ranks of the Ruinous Ones were no easy feat to bring down. Norscans, Beastmen, the warhost of disciples from the Chaos Wastes itself – all the twisted Chaos-things which drew their immense strength from beyond the void, from the very realm of Chaos itself. This was the strength which Snikch’s master craved.\n\nThe location of the great power was finally revealed to Snikch through the words of the Chaos warhost’s Sorcerer, who had vainly attempted to bargain for his own release. “You are a fool, ratling peon,” the Sorcerer shrieked, “for the power you seek is a Daemon of Slaanesh, and no minor Daemon at that! Tz’arkan, the Drinker of Worlds, is a ravenous monster inextricably bound to the soul of a living entity. The only chance of severing the Chaos-imbued bond is to destroy the vessel in which the Daemon is trapped. That vessel is none other than the Druchii known as Malus Darkblade.”\n\nThe prospect of wielding the power of a Daemon suddenly sounded very good to the Deathmaster. Almost as soon as he’d ordered his spies to find Darkblade’s location, word returned that the Druchii tyrant was in the area, but about to board his Black Ark back to Naggaroth. He cannot be allowed to escape!	skv/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	true	Quest	wh2_dlc14_qb_skv_final_battle_snikch	907	469	true	true	10.0000	1536102747	false	Success!

vco_wh2_dlc16_qb_skv_final_battle_throt	FIGHT_SET_PIECE_BATTLE	The Ultimate Harvest	Following Throt’s repeated attacks upon the Waystone sites in Naggaroth, Ariel has begun her ritual in the Witchwood! From the moment Clan Moulder had learned about the Mage Queen’s plans, Throt wondered how such a juicy tip-off could so conveniently land on his lap, but assumed it had something to do with the forest-things’ squabbles amongst themselves. It matters little to him now – with Ariel’s powers focused on her ritual, she is exposed, giving Throt the chance to finally obtain the greatest specimen he will likely ever get his foul claws on. By his haphazard calculations, consuming the demigoddess’ life essence will not only cure his extreme case of the Black Hunger, but could also make him more powerful than he could ever imagine. Moreover, after having his fill who knows what delightfully horrible things he can create in his laboratory using the leftover Queen-pulp? The possibilities are endless!\n\nAs purported by the tree-thing informant, Ariel should be vulnerable while she performs her ritual, but will not be unprotected. She will undoubtedly have her strongest lieutenants defending her, so Throt must fill his ranks with Moulder’s most dangerous monsters to ensure nothing can stop him from claiming Ariel as his prize.	skv/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	true	Quest	wh2_dlc16_qb_skv_final_battle_throt	358	566	true	true	10.0000	1806854659	false	Success!

vco_wh2_dlc16_qb_wef_final_battle_sisters	FIGHT_SET_PIECE_BATTLE	The Root of Chaos	Though the Great Vortex stifles Daemonkind, a rift in the Witchwood provides Chaos with another passageway into the world. Ariel, demigoddess of the Asrai and avatar of Isha, channels all her power to seal the portal, hoping to prevent the Daemons of the Dreaming Wood from entering the mortal plane. Somehow, the scheming Skaven know the Mage Queen is vulnerable, and are preparing to attack. The Sisters of Twilight must dispatch them before they can disrupt Ariel’s efforts and bring cataclysm to the world.	wef/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Quest	wh2_dlc16_qb_wef_final_battle_sisters	42	504	true	true	10.0000	2109289604	true	Success!

vco_wh3_main_ie_qb_bst_final_battle_taurox	FIGHT_SET_PIECE_BATTLE	The Heart of the Dark	Finally, the beast-paths to the Heart of the Dark are revealed! Taurox had marauded mercilessly through the world, the promise of further gifts of Chaos fuelling his never-ending stampede. His Masters’ true goal, however, had always been to usher the Daemons of Chaos into the world, and only a pilgrimage of sacrifice and Ruin, ending at the Heart of the Dark, would make it so.\n\nIt appears others have made the journey also – some with different intentions – but with the final rite within his grasp the Brass Bull will not be denied the Gods’ favour!	emp/generic	rom_event_mission.png	false	false	Quest	vco_wh2_dlc17_qb_bst_final_battle_taurox	397	543	true	true	10.0000	6070318	true	Success!
